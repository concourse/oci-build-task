# `oci-build` task

A Concourse task for building [OCI
images](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec). Currently uses
[`buildkit`](http://github.com/moby/buildkit) for building.

A stretch goal of this is to support running without `privileged: true`, though
it currently still requires it.

## usage

The task implementation is available as an image on Docker Hub at
[`concourse/oci-build-task`](http://hub.docker.com/r/concourse/oci-build-task).
(This image is built from [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) using the `oci-build` task
itself.)

This task implementation started as a spike to explore patterns around
[reusable tasks](https://github.com/concourse/rfcs/issues/7) to hopefully lead
to a proper RFC. Until that RFC is written and implemented, configuration is
still done by way of providing your own task config as follows:

### `image_resource`

First, your task needs to point to the `oci-build-task` image:

```yaml
image_resource:
  type: registry-image
  source:
    repository: concourse/oci-build-task
```

### `params`

Any of the following optional parameters may be specified. These are all exposed
as _environment variables_ to the task, therefore only string values are
allowed. This is a pain point with re-usable tasks that will ideally be resolved
by [prototypes](https://github.com/concourse/rfcs/blob/master/037-prototypes/proposal.md).

* `CONTEXT` (default `.`): the path to the directory to provide as the context
  for the build.

* `DOCKERFILE` (default `$CONTEXT/Dockerfile`): the path to the `Dockerfile`
  to build.

* `BUILDKIT_SSH` your ssh key location that is mounted in your `Dockerfile`. This is
  generally used for pulling dependencies from private repositories.

  For Example. In your `Dockerfile`, you can mount a key as
  ```
  RUN --mount=type=ssh,id=github_ssh_key pip install -U -r ./hats/requirements-test.txt
  ```

  Then in your Concourse YAML configuration:
  ```
  params:
    BUILDKIT_SSH: github_ssh_key=<PATH-TO-YOUR-KEY>
  ```

  Read more about ssh mount [here](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/).

* `BUILD_ARG_*`: params prefixed with `BUILD_ARG_` will be provided as build
  args. For example `BUILD_ARG_foo=bar`, will set the `foo` build arg as `bar`.

* `BUILD_ARGS_FILE` (default empty): path to a file containing build args. By
    default the task will assume each line is in the form `foo=bar`, one per
    line. Empty lines are skipped. If the file ends in `yml` or `yaml` it will
    be parsed as a YAML file. The YAML file can only contain string keys and
    values.

  Example simple file contents:

  ```
  EMAIL=me@example.com
  HOW_MANY_THINGS=1
  DO_THING=false
  ```
  Example YAML file contents:

  ```yaml
  EMAIL: me@example.com
  HOW_MANY_THINGS: "1"
  DO_THING: "false"
  MULTI_LINE_ARG: |
    thing1
    thing2
  ```

* `BUILDKIT_SECRET_*`: files with extra secrets which are made available via
  `--mount=type=secret,id=...`. See [New Docker Build secret information](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/#new-docker-build-secret-information) for more information on build secrets.

  For example, running with `BUILDKIT_SECRET_config=my-repo/config` will allow
  you to do the following...

  ```
  RUN --mount=type=secret,id=config cat /run/secrets/config
  ```

* `BUILDKIT_SECRETTEXT_*`: literal text of extra secrets to be made available
  via the same mechanism described for `$BUILDKIT_SECRET_*` above. The
  difference is that this is easier to use with credential managers:

  `BUILDKIT_SECRETTEXT_mysecret=(( mysecret ))` puts the content that
  `(( mysecret ))` expands to in `/run/secrets/mysecret`.

* `IMAGE_ARG_*`: params prefixed with `IMAGE_ARG_*` point to image tarballs
  (i.e. `docker save` format) or path to images in OCI layout format, to preload
  so that they do not have to be fetched during the build. An image reference
  will be provided as the given build arg name. For example,
  `IMAGE_ARG_base_image=ubuntu/image.tar` will set `base_image` to a local image
  reference for using `ubuntu/image.tar`.

  This must be accepted as an argument for use; for example:

  ```
  ARG base_image
  FROM ${base_image}
  ```

* `IMAGE_PLATFORM`: Specify the target platform(s) to build the image for. For
  example `IMAGE_PLATFORM=linux/arm64,linux/amd64` will build the image for the
  Linux OS and architectures `arm64` and `amd64`. By default, images will be
  built for the current worker's platform that the task is running on.

* `LABEL_*`: params prefixed with `LABEL_` will be set as image labels.
  For example `LABEL_foo=bar`, will set the `foo` label to `bar`.

* `LABELS_FILE` (default empty): path to a file containing labels in
  the form `foo=bar`, one per line. Empty lines are skipped.

* `TARGET` (default empty): a target build stage to build, as named with the
  `FROM â€¦ AS <NAME>` syntax in your `Dockerfile`.

* `TARGET_FILE` (default empty): path to a file containing the name of the
  target build stage to build.

* `ADDITIONAL_TARGETS` (default empty): a comma-separated (`,`) list of
  additional target build stages to build.

* `REGISTRY_MIRRORS` (default empty): a comma-separated (`,`) list of registry
  mirrors to use for `docker.io`. If you need to specify authentication details
  then consider using `BUILDKIT_EXTRA_CONFIG` instead.

* `UNPACK_ROOTFS` (default `false`): unpack the image as Concourse's image
  format (`rootfs/`, `metadata.json`) for use with the [`image` task step
  option](https://concourse-ci.org/jobs.html#schema.step.task-step.image).

* `OUTPUT_OCI` (default `false`): outputs an OCI compliant image, allowing
  for multi-arch image builds when setting IMAGE_PLATFORM to
  [multiple platforms](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/extensions-sdk/extensions/multi-arch/).
  The image output format will be a directory when this flag is set to true.

* `BUILDKIT_ADD_HOSTS` (default empty): extra host definitions for `buildkit`
  to properly resolve custom hostnames. The value is as comma-separated
  (`,`) list of key-value pairs (using syntax `hostname=ip-address`), each
  defining an IP address for resolving some custom hostname.

* `BUILDKIT_EXTRA_CONFIG` (default empty): a string written verbatim to builkit's
  TOML config file. See [buildkitd.toml](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/toml-configuration/).

### `inputs`

There are no required inputs - your task should just list each artifact it
needs as an input. Typically this is in close correlation with `$CONTEXT`:

```yaml
params:
  CONTEXT: my-image

inputs:
- name: my-image
```

Should your build be dependent on multiple inputs, you may want to leave
`CONTEXT` as its default (`.`) and set an explicit path to the `DOCKERFILE`:

```yaml
params:
  DOCKERFILE: my-repo/Dockerfile

inputs:
- name: my-repo
- name: some-dependency
```

It might also make sense to place one input under another, like so:

```yaml
params:
  CONTEXT: my-repo

inputs:
- name: my-repo
- name: some-dependency
  path: my-repo/some-dependency
```

Or, to fully rely on the default behavior and use `path` to wire up the context
accordingly, you could set your primary context as `path: .` and set up any
additional inputs underneath:

```yaml
inputs:
- name: my-repo
  path: .
- name: some-dependency
```

### `outputs`

A single output named `image` may be configured:

```yaml
outputs:
- name: image
```

Use [`output_mapping`] to map this output to a different name in your build plan.
This approach should be used if you're building multiple images in parallel so that
they can have distinct names.

[`output_mapping`]: https://concourse-ci.org/jobs.html#schema.step.task-step.output_mapping

The output will contain the following files:

* `image.tar`: the OCI image tarball. This tarball can be uploaded to a
  registry using the [Registry Image
  resource](https://github.com/concourse/registry-image-resource#out-push-an-image-up-to-the-registry-under-the-given-tags).

* `digest`: the digest of the OCI config. This file can be used to tag the
  image after it has been loaded with `docker load`, like so:

  ```sh
  docker load -i image/image.tar
  docker tag $(cat image/digest) my-name
  ```

If `$UNPACK_ROOTFS` is configured, the following additional entries will be
created:

* `rootfs/*`: the unpacked contents of the image's filesystem.

* `metadata.json`: a JSON file containing the image's env and user
  configuration.

This is a Concourse-specific format to support using the newly built image for
a subsequent task by pointing the task step's [`image`
option](https://concourse-ci.org/task-step.html#task-step-image) to the output,
like so:

```yaml
plan:
- task: build-image
  params:
    UNPACK_ROOTFS: true
  output_mapping: {image: my-built-image}
- task: use-image
  image: my-built-image
```

(The `output_mapping` here is just for clarity; alternatively you could just
set `image: image`.)

> Note: at some point Concourse will likely standardize on OCI instead.

### `caches`

Caching can be enabled by caching the `cache` path on the task:

```yaml
caches:
- path: cache
```

This only caches the build layers that Buildkit makes and will only be hit if
the same worker is used between one build and the next.

NOTE: the contents of `--mount=type=cache` directories are not cached, see https://github.com/concourse/oci-build-task/issues/87

### `run`

Your task should run the `build` executable:

```yaml
run:
  path: build
```


## migrating from the `docker-image` resource

The `docker-image` resource was previously used for building and pushing a
Docker image to a registry in one fell swoop.

The `oci-build` task, in contrast, only supports building images - it does not
support pushing or even tagging the image. It can be used to build an image and
use it for a subsequent task image without pushing it to a registry, by
configuring `$UNPACK_ROOTFS`.

In order to push the newly built image, you can use a resource like the
[`registry-image`
resource](https://github.com/concourse/registry-image-resource) like so:

```yaml
resources:
- name: my-image-src
  type: git
  source:
    uri: https://github.com/...

- name: my-image
  type: registry-image
  source:
    repository: my-user/my-repo

jobs:
- name: build-and-push
  plan:
  # fetch repository source (containing Dockerfile)
  - get: my-image-src

  # build using `oci-build` task
  #
  # note: this task config could be pushed into `my-image-src` and loaded using
  # `file:` instead
  - task: build
    privileged: true
    config:
      platform: linux

      image_resource:
        type: registry-image
        source:
          repository: concourse/oci-build-task

      inputs:
      - name: my-image-src
        path: .

      outputs:
      - name: image

      run:
        path: build

  # push using `registry-image` resource
  - put: my-image
    params: {image: image/image.tar}
```


## example

This repo contains an `example.yml`, which builds the image for the task
itself:

```sh
fly -t dev execute -c example.yml -i context=. -o image=. -p
docker load -i image.tar
```

That `-p` at the end is not a typo; it runs the task with elevated privileges.

## Providing Custom CA Certificates

Assuming your custom CA cert is passed in as an input to the oci-build task,
you can use a task config like this to load your custom CA certificate:

```yaml
platform: linux

inputs:
- name: certs
  path: /var/certs #Absolute path only works on Concourse >=7.5.0
#..other inputs

outputs:
- name: image

params:
  BUILDKIT_EXTRA_CONFIG: |
    [registry."my-registry.com"]
      ca=["/var/certs/my-ca.pem"]

run:
  path: build
```
