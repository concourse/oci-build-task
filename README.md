# `oci-build` task

A Concourse task for building [OCI
images](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec). Currently uses
[`buildkit`](http://github.com/moby/buildkit) for building.

A stretch goal of this is to support running without `privileged: true`, though
it currently still requires it.

## usage

The task implementation is available as an image on Docker Hub at
[`concourse/oci-build-task`](http://hub.docker.com/r/concourse/oci-build-task).
(This image is built from [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) using the `oci-build` task
itself.)

This task implementation started as a spike to explore patterns around
[reusable tasks](https://github.com/concourse/rfcs/issues/7) to hopefully lead
to a proper RFC. Until that RFC is written and implemented, configuration is
still done by way of providing your own task config as follows:

### `image_resource`

First, your task needs to point to the `oci-build-task` image:

```yaml
image_resource:
  type: registry-image
  source:
    repository: concourse/oci-build-task
```

### `params`

Next, any of the following optional parameters may be specified:

_(As a convention in the list below, all task parameters are specified with a
 leading `$`, in order to remind their environment variable nature, just like
 shell variables that one would use with the `$VAR` syntax. When specifying
 those in the `params:` YAML dictionary of a task definition though, the
 leading `$` is irrelevant, as readers will notice in the examples below.)_

* `$CONTEXT` (default `.`): the path to the directory to provide as the context
  for the build.

* `$DOCKERFILE` (default `$CONTEXT/Dockerfile`): the path to the `Dockerfile`
  to build.

* `$BUILDKIT_SSH` your ssh key location that is mounted in your `Dockerfile`. This is
  generally used for pulling dependencies from private repositories.

  For Example. In your `Dockerfile`, you can mount a key as
  ```
  RUN --mount=type=ssh,id=github_ssh_key pip install -U -r ./hats/requirements-test.txt
  ```

  Then in your Concourse YAML configuration:
  ```
  params:
    BUILDKIT_SSH: github_ssh_key=<PATH-TO-YOUR-KEY>
  ```

  Read more about ssh mount [here](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/).

* `$BUILD_ARG_*`: params prefixed with `BUILD_ARG_` will be provided as build
  args. For example `BUILD_ARG_foo=bar`, will set the `foo` build arg as `bar`.

* `$BUILD_ARGS_FILE` (default empty): path to a file containing build args in
  the form `foo=bar`, one per line. Empty lines are skipped.

  Example file contents:

  ```
  EMAIL=me@yopmail.com
  HOW_MANY_THINGS=1
  DO_THING=false
  ```

* `$BUILDKIT_SECRET_*`: files with extra secrets which are made available via
  `--mount=type=secret,id=...`. See [New Docker Build secret information](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/#new-docker-build-secret-information) for more information on build secrets.

  For example, running with `BUILDKIT_SECRET_config=my-repo/config` will allow
  you to do the following...

  ```
  RUN --mount=type=secret,id=config cat /run/secrets/config
  ```

* `$BUILDKIT_SECRETTEXT_*`: literal text of extra secrets to be made available
  via the same mechanism described for `$BUILDKIT_SECRET_*` above. The
  difference is that this is easier to use with credential managers:

  `BUILDKIT_SECRETTEXT_mysecret=(( mysecret ))` puts the content that
  `(( mysecret ))` expands to in `/run/secrets/mysecret`.

* `$IMAGE_ARG_*`: params prefixed with `IMAGE_ARG_*` point to image tarballs
  (i.e. `docker save` format) to preload so that they do not have to be fetched
  during the build. An image reference will be provided as the given build arg
  name. For example, `IMAGE_ARG_base_image=ubuntu/image.tar` will set
  `base_image` to a local image reference for using `ubuntu/image.tar`.

* `$IMAGE_PLATFORM`: Specify the target platform to build the image for. For
  example `IMAGE_PLATFORM=linux/arm64` will build the image for the Linux OS
  and `arm64` architecture. By default, images will be built for the current
  worker's platform that the task is running on.

* `$LABEL_*`: params prefixed with `LABEL_` will be set as image labels.
  For example `LABEL_foo=bar`, will set the `foo` label to `bar`.

* `$LABELS_FILE` (default empty): path to a file containing labels in
  the form `foo=bar`, one per line. Empty lines are skipped.

* `$TARGET` (default empty): a target build stage to build, as named with the
  `FROM â€¦ AS <NAME>` syntax in your `Dockerfile`.

* `$TARGET_FILE` (default empty): path to a file containing the name of the
  target build stage to build.

* `$ADDITIONAL_TARGETS` (default empty): a comma-separated (`,`) list of
  additional target build stages to build.

* `$REGISTRY_MIRRORS` (default empty): registry mirrors to use for `docker.io`.

* `$UNPACK_ROOTFS` (default `false`): unpack the image as Concourse's image
  format (`rootfs/`, `metadata.json`) for use with the [`image` task step
  option](https://concourse-ci.org/jobs.html#schema.step.task-step.image).

* `$BUILDKIT_ADD_HOSTS` (default empty): extra host definitions for `buildkit`
  to properly resolve custom hostnames. The value is as comma-separated
  (`,`) list of key-value pairs (using syntax `hostname=ip-address`), each
  defining an IP address for resolving some custom hostname.

> Note: this is the main pain point with reusable tasks - env vars are kind of
> an awkward way to configure a task. Once the RFC lands these will turn into a
> JSON structure similar to configuring `params` on a resource, and task params
> will become `env` instead.

### `inputs`

There are no required inputs - your task should just list each artifact it
needs as an input. Typically this is in close correlation with `$CONTEXT`:

```yaml
params:
  CONTEXT: my-image

inputs:
- name: my-image
```

Should your build be dependent on multiple inputs, you may want to leave
`$CONTEXT` as its default (`.`) and set an explicit path to the `$DOCKERFILE`:

```yaml
params:
  DOCKERFILE: my-repo/Dockerfile

inputs:
- name: my-repo
- name: some-dependency
```

It might also make sense to place one input under another, like so:

```yaml
params:
  CONTEXT: my-repo

inputs:
- name: my-repo
- name: some-dependency
  path: my-repo/some-dependency
```

Or, to fully rely on the default behavior and use `path` to wire up the context
accordingly, you could set your primary context as `path: .` and set up any
additional inputs underneath:

```yaml
inputs:
- name: my-repo
  path: .
- name: some-dependency
```

### `outputs`

A single output named `image` may be configured:

```yaml
outputs:
- name: image
```

Use [`output_mapping`] to map this output to a different name in your build plan.
This approach should be used if you're building multiple images in parallel so that
they can have distinct names.

[`output_mapping`]: https://concourse-ci.org/jobs.html#schema.step.task-step.output_mapping

The output will contain the following files:

* `image.tar`: the OCI image tarball. This tarball can be uploaded to a
  registry using the [Registry Image
  resource](https://github.com/concourse/registry-image-resource#out-push-an-image-up-to-the-registry-under-the-given-tags).

* `digest`: the digest of the OCI config. This file can be used to tag the
  image after it has been loaded with `docker load`, like so:

  ```sh
  docker load -i image/image.tar
  docker tag $(cat image/digest) my-name
  ```

If `$UNPACK_ROOTFS` is configured, the following additional entries will be
created:

* `rootfs/*`: the unpacked contents of the image's filesystem.

* `metadata.json`: a JSON file containing the image's env and user
  configuration.

This is a Concourse-specific format to support using the newly built image for
a subsequent task by pointing the task step's [`image`
option](https://concourse-ci.org/task-step.html#task-step-image) to the output,
like so:

```yaml
plan:
- task: build-image
  params:
    UNPACK_ROOTFS: true
  output_mapping: {image: my-built-image}
- task: use-image
  image: my-built-image
```

(The `output_mapping` here is just for clarity; alternatively you could just
set `image: image`.)

> Note: at some point Concourse will likely standardize on OCI instead.

### `caches`

Task caching can be enabled by caching the `cache` path on the task:

```yaml
caches:
- path: cache
```

Alternatively, one may configure caching via docker registry:

```yaml
params:
  REGISTRY_CACHE: registry.example.com/my-org/my-image:cache
```

#### Which one to use?

Registry cache allows the caches to be shared by all concourse workers, but it
enables side-effects such as pulling and pushing of cache images to the
docker registry, which may require [authentication](https://github.com/concourse/oci-build-task/issues/14#issuecomment-596731775).

Task cache is easy to set up, but it is not shared by concourse workers.

### `run`

Your task should run the `build` executable:

```yaml
run:
  path: build
```


## migrating from the `docker-image` resource

The `docker-image` resource was previously used for building and pushing a
Docker image to a registry in one fell swoop.

The `oci-build` task, in contrast, only supports building images - it does not
support pushing or even tagging the image. It can be used to build an image and
use it for a subsequent task image without pushing it to a registry, by
configuring `$UNPACK_ROOTFS`.

In order to push the newly built image, you can use a resource like the
[`registry-image`
resource](https://github.com/concourse/registry-image-resource) like so:

```yaml
resources:
- name: my-image-src
  type: git
  source:
    uri: https://github.com/...

- name: my-image
  type: registry-image
  source:
    repository: my-user/my-repo

jobs:
- name: build-and-push
  plan:
  # fetch repository source (containing Dockerfile)
  - get: my-image-src

  # build using `oci-build` task
  #
  # note: this task config could be pushed into `my-image-src` and loaded using
  # `file:` instead
  - task: build
    privileged: true
    config:
      platform: linux

      image_resource:
        type: registry-image
        source:
          repository: concourse/oci-build-task

      inputs:
      - name: my-image-src
        path: .

      outputs:
      - name: image

      run:
        path: build

  # push using `registry-image` resource
  - put: my-image
    params: {image: image/image.tar}
```


## differences from `builder` task

The [`builder` task](https://github.com/concourse/builder-task) was a stepping
stone that led to the `oci-build` task. It is now deprecated. The transition
should be relatively smooth, with the following differences:

* The `oci-build` task does not support configuring `$REPOSITORY` or `$TAG`.
  * for running the image with `docker`, a `digest` file is provided which can
    be tagged with `docker tag`
  * for pushing the image, the repository and tag are configured in the
    [`registry-image`
    resource](https://github.com/concourse/registry-image-resource)
* The `oci-build` task has a more efficient caching implementation. By using
  `buildkit` directly we can make use of its `local` cache exporter/importer,
  which doesn't require a separate translation step for saving into the task
  cache.
* This task is written in Go instead of Bash, and has tests!


## example

This repo contains an `example.yml`, which builds the image for the task
itself:

```sh
fly -t dev execute -c example.yml -o image=. -p
docker load -i image.tar
```

That `-p` at the end is not a typo; it runs the task with elevated privileges.
